Java revise:


****OOPS concepts****

1. Class, Object

2. Inheritance(code reusability)
	Single -> one parent - one child
	Multilevel -> one parent - child 1(subclass/intermediate super class) - child 2
	Hierarchical -> multiple classes are derived from one super class
	Hybrid -> can have combination of different types of inheritance
	Multiple -> due to ambiguity not support in Java by classes

3. Encapsulation/Data Hiding
	Variables(data) and Methods are wrapped in a single unit called a class.
	Variable and Methods are hidden. They can be accessible only via objects.
	To achieve it, make Variables private and Methods(getters/setters) public and access it via objects.

4. Polymorphism 
	Ability of an object to take many forms.
	1. static polymorphism(Method Overloading)
	2. dynamic polymorphism(Method Overriding)

5. Abstraction
	Hiding implementation details and shows only essential ones. complexity hidden.
	2 ways to achieve abstraction in Java
		1. Abstract classes - 0 to 100%
		2. Interfaces - full or 100%
